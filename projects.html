                <h2>Bullet Hell Shooting Game and Level Interpreter</h2>
                <p>The "Bullet Hell Shooting Game and Level Interpreter" is a Java-based project developed using the LibGDX framework as part of the Software Design and Architecture course (CPT_S 587). This project showcases a deep understanding of object-oriented programming and software design principles by implementing design patterns such as factory, state, observer, and command within a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. A key feature of the project is its level interpreter, which reads configurations from JSON files, allowing dynamic generation and modification of game levels. This approach ensures high configurability and ease of extension without altering the core codebase. Through this project, we demonstrate proficiency in Java, system design, game logic, and problem-solving, creating a robust and maintainable gaming application.</p>

                <h2>Exploring and Visualizing Personal Trends with Spotify</h2>
                <p>This project analyzes and visualizes individual music listening habits using data retrieved from Spotify. By using Spotify's Web API, the project collects detailed user-specific data and processes it to uncover trends and patterns. Key analytical techniques include centrality measures to identify favorite artists, community detection to discover clusters of frequently listened-to artists, and temporal analysis to reveal peak listening times. The project aims to provide insightful visualizations that enhance user experience, allowing individuals to discover new music and reflect on their musical tastes. Developed as part of the CPT_S 591 Elements of Network Science course at Washington State University, this work combines data science and network analysis to offer a comprehensive view of personal music consumption.</p>
