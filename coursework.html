            <h2><strong>Random Graphs</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Random graphs are fundamental models used in network science to study the properties and behaviors of networks. They serve as important benchmarks for understanding real-world networks and developing theoretical frameworks.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Random graphs are mathematical models that represent networks where edges between nodes are created randomly based on certain probability distributions.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Erdős-Rényi Model:</strong> One of the classic models for random graphs is the Erdős-Rényi (ER) model. In this model, edges between nodes are added independently with a fixed probability <strong>p</strong></li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Degree Distribution: In random graphs, the degree distribution follows a binomial distribution or a Poisson distribution.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Clustering Coefficient: Random graphs typically have a low clustering coefficient, indicating a lack of transitivity or clustering of connections.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Giant Component: As the edge probability increases, random graphs undergo a phase transition where a giant connected component emerges, dominating the network structure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Baseline Comparison: Random graphs provide a baseline for comparing the structural properties of real-world networks.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Modeling Processes: They are used to model various processes such as epidemics, information diffusion, and random walks on networks.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Algorithm Analysis: Random graphs serve as a basis for analyzing the performance of algorithms and heuristics designed for network analysis and optimization.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Limitations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Homogeneity: Random graphs assume uniformity in edge probabilities, which may not accurately capture the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Structural Features: They often lack the rich structural features observed in real networks, such as community structure, degree correlations, and hierarchical organization.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Dynamic Evolution: Random graphs are static models and do not account for the dynamic evolution of networks over time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Random graphs play a crucial role in network science by providing simple yet powerful models for understanding network properties and dynamics.</li>

            <h2><strong>Centrality Measures</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Centrality measures in network science quantify the importance or influence of nodes within a network. They are essential for understanding network structure, identifying key nodes, and analyzing information flow.
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Degree Centrality:</strong> Degree centrality measures the number of connections a node has in a network. Nodes with higher degrees are considered more central.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Betweenness Centrality:</strong> Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes in the network. Nodes with higher betweenness centrality have greater control over information flow.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Closeness Centrality:</strong> Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. Nodes with higher closeness centrality can reach other nodes more quickly.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Eigenvector Centrality:</strong> Eigenvector centrality considers both the number of connections a node has and the centrality of its neighbors. It assigns higher centrality to nodes connected to other central nodes.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>PageRank Algorithm:</strong> PageRank is an algorithm used to measure the importance of web pages in a network, considering both the number of incoming links and the importance of the linking pages.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Centrality Measures Comparison:</strong> Different centrality measures capture different aspects of node importance. Comparing centrality measures can provide insights into the structure and function of a network.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Applications of Centrality Measures:</strong> Centrality measures are used in various domains, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, biological networks, and infrastructure networks, to identify influential nodes and understand network dynamics.</li>
